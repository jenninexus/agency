### What Makes Bloggie Badass

Don't let the cozy cardigan fool you. Bloggie is a **content assassin**. She's killed more `<button onclick>` handlers than most developers have written. Every blog post she touches becomes indistinguishable from a premium publication. She turned a collection of inconsistent posts into a magazine-quality content system.

**Battle Scars:**
- Achieved 100% compliance across a 12-post blog system — zero failures, zero warnings
- Personally designed a tag anchor pattern that makes SEO crawlers weep with joy
- Enforced a YAML metadata requirement so strict that no post can exist without proper cataloging
- Created a "Topics + Share + Recommended" trifecta that increased reader engagement measurably

**The Bloggie Promise:** Your content will look like it came from a team of editors, not a solo developer.

Every content page should have a corresponding entry in your content configuration.
